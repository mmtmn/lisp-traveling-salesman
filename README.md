This code implements a solution to the travelling salesperson problem. It defines a function, `find-shortest-path`, which takes two arguments - a graph and a start-node. The graph is a list of associations, each of which represents a node in the graph and is associated with a list of edges to other nodes. Each edge is associated with a length.

The function works by using a recursive algorithm. It first initializes two variables - `unvisited`, which is a copy of the graph with the start-node removed, and `shortest-path`, which is initially set to nil.

It then defines an inner function, `build-path`, which takes two arguments - `node` and `path`. This function works by recursively building a path to the destination node. It first checks if there are any unvisited nodes. If there are, it finds the shortest edge to any of them, pushes the `node` onto the `path` and removes the corresponding node from the `unvisited` list. It then calls `build-path` with the shortest-node and the new `path`. If there are no unvisited nodes, it pushes the `node` onto the `path` and sets `shortest-path` to the `path`.

Finally, the `find-shortest-path` calls the `build-path` function with the start-node and an empty path, and returns the resulting `shortest-path`.

To demonstrate the algorithm, an example graph is created, representing the travelling salesperson problem, and the algorithm is run on it. The result is the shortest possible path from the start-node to the destination, which is (A B E F C D).
